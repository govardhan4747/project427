    <h1>WHY I MADE THIS....</h1>
    
    <p id="animated-text"
       data-text="This project is very special to me — it's my first website after I began learning web development in November 2024. So yes, it may not be perfect or super fast, but it’s built with everything I have. And it's made for you. I built this entire website from scratch, completely on my own. Every small detail — every word, every animation, every page — reflects something deeply personal to me: our friendship, and how much I truly value it. I didn’t create this just because you’re talking to me now or to impress you. The idea was born way back in December 2024. At first, I thought of making some website for you — but later, I felt a birthday website would be more meaningful. Even if we hadn’t talked again… somehow, I had decided to send this website link to you anyway. This might just be a webpage on the internet — but to me, it's a memory, a first milestone for my skills, and a special webpage to me. I hope this makes you feel special. If it makes you feel even a little happy, if it brings a smile to your face… then I’ve succeeded.">
