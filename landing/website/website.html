    <h1>WHY I MADE THIS....</h1>
    
    <p id="animated-text"
       data-text="This project means a lot to me — it’s actually the very first full website I built since I started learning web development in November 2024. So no, it might not be perfect or the fastest thing ever — but it’s built with everything I’ve got. And it’s made just for you.

I made the entire thing from scratch, completely on my own. Every word, every animation, every color, every little page — it all holds a bit of what I feel.

This wasn’t something I started just because we began talking again, or to impress you. The idea came to me way back in December 2024. At first, I thought of creating something simple… but then I felt — a birthday website would be more meaningful. Even if we hadn’t reconnected, I still would’ve built it just the way it is now… and somehow, I would’ve sent it to you.

Yeah, maybe it’s just a webpage. But for me. It’s a memory — something I truly wanted to build. A small gift from my side, to you.Hope this becomes one of the memories for you.

If it makes you smile, even for a second... then that’s more than enough for me :)
